# TECHNOQUIZ: E-Learning Platform for Programmers
## Introduction
  Mobile applications have become a vital part of our everyday lives in the age of technology breakthroughs, transforming different elements of communication, recreational activities, and education. The integration of mobile apps with traditional learning methods has resulted in substantial gains in the sphere of education, in particular. With the increased need for creative and engaging learning tools, there is a rising need for a mobile quiz application developed exclusively for Batangas State University's BSCS (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science) and BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) departments. Thus, the goal of this project is to create and construct a mobile quiz app called "TechnoQuiz" to improve students' learning experiences in these departments.

  
The TechnoQuiz app aims to provide a convenient and dynamic platform for students to test their understanding, reinforce concepts, and remain up to date on the newest technological breakthroughs. This application will provide a flexible learning experience by utilizing the capabilities of mobile devices, allowing students to connect with the course material outside of the typical classroom setting. TechnoQuiz will encourage students to take an active role in their own learning process with a user interface that is easy to use and well-designed features, encouraging a culture of continual development and academic success.

  Batangas State University - The National Engineering University, especially Batangas State University -  Alangilan Campus , is well-known for its significant concentration on technology-related courses, with the BSCS and BSIT departments playing important roles in the production of skilled professionals in the sector. Traditional evaluation methods of professional instructors, such as written tests and quizzes, may not always capture students' real ability or provide rapid feedback for growth. The TechnoQuiz app strives to address these constraints by offering an interactive and engaging assessment tool which enables students to apply and evaluate their understanding in real time.

  The TechnoQuiz app will have a huge collection of technology-related questions that will be divided into topics and difficulty levels. Students will be able to select their favourite topics, take timed quizzes, and measure their development over time. The app will also have performance statistics, which will allow students to discover their strengths as well as their weaknesses and recommend appropriate study materials to help them better understand specific topics. Furthermore, TechnoQuiz will develop a sense of drive and academic success among students by giving leaderboards and achievements.

  The effective creation and deployment of TechnoQuiz has the potential to transform the learning experience of Batangas State University's BSCS and BSIT students. This mobile quiz software will provide a rich and engaging learning platform by bringing technology into the educational journey, developing critical thinking abilities, retention of information, and academic advancement. The following chapters of this thesis will go into detail about the TechnoQuiz app's design, development, and evaluation procedures, resulting in a comprehensive solution adapted to the specific demands and objectives of the BSCS and BSIT departments.
