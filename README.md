# TECHNOQUIZ: A Learning Platform for Programmers
Mobile applications have become a vital part of our everyday lives in the age of technology breakthroughs, transforming different elements of communication, recreational activities, and education. The integration of mobile apps with traditional learning methods has resulted in substantial gains in the sphere of education, in particular. With the increased need for creative and engaging learning tools, there is a rising need for a mobile quiz application developed exclusively for Batangas State University's BSCS (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science) and BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) departments. Thus, the goal of this project is to create and construct a mobile quiz app called "TechnoQuiz" to improve students' learning experiences in these departments.
